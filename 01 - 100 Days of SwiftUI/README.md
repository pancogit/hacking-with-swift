# 100 Days of SwiftUI

SwiftUI is Apple's framework for creating beautiful user interfaces. It is modern way of building iOS applications. Lessons are separated to the specific topics and very well organized by chapters. It is suitable for beginners who wants to learn how to build iOS applications without any prior mobile development experience. There are 100 days of learning. Each day covers material which requires about one hour of practice. Pauses, stops or just simple coding can be done at any period of time to relearn what is missing or to practice material more. Days are grouped by topics and new things are gradually added.
